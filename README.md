# gRPC-101 ðŸ’½

Hi! My name is Lidia ðŸ‘‹

If you have just stumpled upon this repo while going through my GitHub, welcome! This repo is part of a "series" of 101s.

I am a MERN Stack developer and Teaching Assistant at EPICODE. I specialize in MongoDB (+ Postgres), Express.js, React.js and Node.js.

As part of autonomous research, I am trying out different things. You can find a list of what I have explored so far and what I plan to try next on my GitHub page.

This is the repository for the basics of creating a gRPC server that can be consumed by my frontend. I followed <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw4rkaTc0f8'> this tutorial </a> for the practical part, and 
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl9AZieRUaw'> this conference </a> for the theorical part.

Today my goal is to create an API that can execute all CRUD operations.

Do you have feedback? Do not hesitate! Coding is all about always learning something new!

To run this, I suggest splitting your terminal and running `npm run dev` on one terminal, manipulate the `client.js` file to test the different endpoints and finally running `node client.js` on the second terminal.
